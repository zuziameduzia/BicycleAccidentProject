# BicycleAccidentProject
This project analyzes bicycle accidents in Great Britain in the years 1979-2018. The data used for it was downloaded from the Kaggle website (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnharshith/bicycle-accidents-in-great-britain-1979-to-2018). The script was written in BigQuery. 

As part of the project, I also made a dashboard in LookerStudio, which can be viewed at the link https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/7c6b160e-cc29-4b3f-8f7c-7d8d9338b86a
