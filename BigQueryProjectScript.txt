--conclusion: Most accidents in GB between 1979 and 2018 (495 730) occurred in clear weather, when roads were dry and the injuries suffered by accident victims were fortunately not serious.

--conclusion: The highest average of bicycle accident casualties in Great Britain between 1979 and 2018 was 2 for a speed limit of 26 km/h.

--conclusion: The participants in most bicycle accidents (74.4%) in Great Britain between 1979 and 2018 were men aged 6-55.
